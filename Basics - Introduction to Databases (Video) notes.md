    + Records/rows: represent specific objects in a collection
    + Records/rows: repeating data structure of some sort that has descriptive values about each row or record.
  - Implicit or explicit named values that describe ore represent information associated with the object of each "record".
  - "Records" in collection usually accessed
    + Sequentially in a known order
    + Randomly based on search criteria
